# Badger Maths

This library implements some basic mathematical functions that work around
the imprecision in the IEEE 754 standard which Javascript uses for floating
point numbers.

They were originally written using a fixed floating point algorithm based
on the code in [Sinful.js](https://github.com/guipn/sinful.js).

They are now implemented as Typescript wrappers around
[big.js](https://mikemcl.github.io/big.js/).
